# AI Project: Map Matching and Destination Recommendation System

This repository contains the project developed during an AI course, focusing on real-world applications of AI techniques. The project is divided into two phases:

1. **Map Matching using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**:
   - In this phase, we implement a Map Matching algorithm using HMM to align GPS traces with the most probable paths on a map. This is particularly useful for applications in navigation systems and location-based services.

2. **Destination Recommendation System**:
   - The second phase involves creating a recommendation system that suggests potential destinations based on historical travel data and user preferences. This system leverages various machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.

### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, torch, KeplerGL, XGBoost, etc.
